# Python-Code

**Me**

Hi, My name is Susan Ling

For 20 years I wrote code in Cobol, working for Aviva, Norwich and then for about 5 years I went freelance and worked around the uk for big named companies, including working back
at Aviva as a freelance Cobol programmer, then returning again to Aviva copying up Cobol programs for the people that the Cobol code had been outsourced to.

One day there was no Cobol work and I didnt work again for 20 years. My partner was a Cobol Analyst. He went to work as a clerk for the local Council.

But things changed in my life (my partner died) and I thought that I would get a degree, so I could be a computer programmer again. I am currently studying for an Open University IT Degree.
I was still in the mindset of 20 years ago ... 1) That I needed to get a degree to work in IT. 2) That Aviva was the only possible employer for miles around.

But Im slowly learning just how much has changed in the last 20 years ... I didnt need to get a degree !!! ... I could just self learn.
I have discovered Code First Girls, Freecodecamp and Codecademy. 

So I am slowly rediscovering coding again. Python, CSS, HTML, Php and JavaScript through the Open University and Code First Girls.

I dont really know how to use GitHub.

This is not a hobby for me. I want to be earning a living. But I do love coding and I feel like Im coming alive again.

There are 2 small Python projects in this repository and they are not connected.





The 2 projects are not connected in any way by their code.
