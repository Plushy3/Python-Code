# Python-Code

**Me**

Hi, My name is Susan Ling

For 20 years I wrote code in Cobol, working for Aviva, Norwich and then for about 5 years I went freelance and worked around the uk for big named companies, including working back at Aviva as a freelance Cobol programmer, then returning again to Aviva copying up Cobol programs for the people that the Cobol code had been outsourced to.

One day there was no Cobol work and I didnt work again for 20 years. My partner was a Cobol Analyst. He went to work as a clerk for the local Council.

But things changed in my life (my partner died) and I thought that I would get a degree, so I could be a computer programmer again. I am currently studying for an Open University IT Degree.

I was still in the mindset of 20 years ago ... 1) That I needed to get a degree to work in IT. 2) That Aviva was the only possible employer for miles around.

But Im slowly learning just how much has changed in the last 20 years ... I didnt need to get a degree !!! ... I could just self learn.

I have discovered Code First Girls, Freecodecamp and Codecademy. 

So I am slowly rediscovering coding again. Python, CSS, HTML, Php and JavaScript through the Open University and Code First Girls (Python).

I dont really know how to use GitHub.

This is 'not' a hobby for me. I want to be earning a living. I do love coding and I feel like I am coming alive again.

There are 2 small Python projects in this repository and their code is not connected.

Project 1 (Open University - Draw a Frieze) : Open University - My 1st ever Python program/code to draw a pattern that is repeated 4 times using Python Turtle (import turtle).
                                                                You need to just run that one piece of Python code and it draws you a line pattern as you watch.


Project 2 (Code First Girls - Kickstarter Python Course - 8 week course) - 2nd ever Python program - to read their provided .csv file and to produce figures/calculations from 
                                                                                                     their data -
                                                                                                     but you do have a free reign and their calculations are a suggestion. 
                                                                                                     sales.csv file is the input file used by the python program.
                                                                                                     To run this Python code you need the provided .csv file whos url is hardcoded in a line in the program.
                                                                                                     This program draws a barchart on the screen while you watch.


            So I am on my 2nd week of the Code First Girls 8 week course. 
                    I know that there is a final project to do - you pick 1 project from a choice of 3.
                            I have a sheet that tells me all 3 projects and it tells me how to read a .csv file in Python (sales.csv) (only used in the 3rd project)

                            Thats all I needed to know !! ... So I write the code to read the sales.csv file, on my 2nd week of the course and produce the asked for calculations from one of the 2 amount columns in the .csv file.

                            Then I have a eureka moment. Can I draw a barchart with lines using turtle ? (turtle was learnt in Open Univerity Project 1, above) ... so I then find that turtle will actually visually draw a nice barchart, then I learn that you can fill colour into the skeleton bars of the chart. 
                            
                            But my calculation figures appear on the program output screen and the chart appears in a separate white page window. I figure out how to move the calculations onto the same white page window as the barchart print. 
                            
                            I then add a heading to the barchart and months under each of the 12 monthly figures of the barchart. 
                            
                            I have now produced calculations and a monthly barchart for the sales figures in the sales.csv file. 
                                                        
                            But there is another set of data in the csv file for expenditure. So I added these figures in barchart form and did the same calculations for the expenditure column figures.

                            The sales and expenditure data are combined into the one barchart, with the bars next to each other.
